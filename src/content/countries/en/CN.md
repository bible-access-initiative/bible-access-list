# An Overview of Bible Access in China

In a nation of 1.4 billion people, millions of believers are still waiting for a Bible they can’t obtain. China is home to more than 100 million Christians—a small percentage of the population, but a vast number in absolute terms. And yet, many of them still don’t have access to God’s Word. Severe restrictions mean that even though some believers do own a Bible, millions more find it
out of reach.

Bible access in China is complicated. While on the surface, there appears to be some religious freedom; access remains tightly controlled. The Amity Printing Press in Nanjing is the only authorized facility permitted to print Bibles in China. Each year, it produces an estimated 11–15 million Bibles; however, the vast majority are exported. For the local Chinese market, the government imposes a strict quota of approximately 2 million copies annually. These limited quantities are distributed exclusively through the government-sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic

Movement (TSPM) church bookstores and the official, state-controlled Protestant church network, making it difficult for many to obtain scripture. For the remainder of Chinese believers, who attend unregistered house churches, Bible access is far harder. Printing or distributing Bibles outside of government control is illegal, and discovery can lead to serious consequences. Restrictions also apply to quantity, as it can be dangerous to own more than one Bible in some areas, leading some to hide their or even delete Bible apps from their phones to avoid surveillance.

What about going online? Since March 2022, unauthorized Bible distribution online has been
banned. Christian websites and apps are often blocked, and online activity is closely watched.
Some believers say they can still find ways to read Scripture digitally, but they must do so
carefully to avoid detection.
And yet, the hunger for Scripture is growing, especially in the poorer, less-developed western,
central, and northern provinces, where Bibles remain both scarce and expensive. While Bibles
may be somewhat easier to find in major cities and coastal regions, believers in the country’s
interior face far greater barriers. Poverty makes it nearly impossible for many to purchase a
copy, leaving countless believers waiting and praying for God’s Word to reach them.
