The national restriction metric assesses governmental barriers and how freely citizens can bring Bibles into their country.
Print or publish them, store and possess physical copies, and share or distribute them. Higher scores indicate tighter controls, which can manifest as confiscation or limited import quotas at the border, government-required licenses for printing, legal penalties for holding more than a certain quantity, official registration of religious materials, or the criminalization of Bible ownership. In extreme cases, merely sharing or distributing Bibles—through proselytizing or handing them out—can be met with harsh penalties or the necessity for special government permits.
