# The Church Metric
### Tracking:
- Bible Possession among Believers
- Church Size
- Church Growth
- CPM / DMM Presence

The Church metric set is designed to pinpoint where and how Bibles are most urgently needed within the Christian community.
It does this by looking at indicators such as how many believers actually own a Bible, as well as church size and growth trends, to gauge the overall strength and reach of Scripture engagement. At the same time, tracking Church Planting Movements and Disciple Making Movements helps capture how rapidly new faith communities are forming or multiplying.

The "Bibles among Believers" and "Church Growth" metrics are deeply interconnected, as they both reflect the accessibility and influence of Scripture within expanding faith communities. A thriving church movement corresponds with a rising demand for Bibles, as new believers seek to engage with Scripture personally and within their congregations. Conversely, higher Bible ownership and engagement can fuel church growth by strengthening discipleship, deepening faith, and equipping believers to share the Gospel.

External pressures, such as levels of conflict or disaster, are also taken into account to highlight where the need for spiritual support and resource distribution is most pressing. All these indicators feed into a combined score that can go up to 85, providing a clear snapshot of both current needs and the opportunities to deepen Bible engagement. Ultimately, these insights guide ministries and organizations in determining where to channel their support and resources for maximum impact.
