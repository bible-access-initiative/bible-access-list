The Bible Access List Community Metric is designed to evaluate a collection of community factors that influence the accessibility, distribution, and engagement with scripture. By tracking the following submetrics, this tool helps organizations and ministries identify areas of need and strategically allocate support:

### Poverty Level;
Assesses the economic conditions within a community. Higher poverty levels often indicate limited financial resources, which can hinder access to printed Bibles or digital devices needed for scripture engagement.

### Internet Access
Measures the availability and reliability of internet connectivity. Since digital Bibles and online study resources play an increasingly important role, communities with lower connectivity may require alternative or offline methods of distribution.

### Logistics
Evaluates transportation networks, infrastructure, and overall ease of shipping or delivering resources. In areas with challenging logistics, more creative or long-term planning is needed to bring in materials and personnel.

### Population
Tracks the community size and density. Understanding how many people reside in a given region enables targeted outreach and helps anticipate resource demands.

### Electricity
Monitors electrical power stability and coverage. Reliable electricity is crucial for charging devices used for digital Bible study and maintaining communication with ministry partners.

### Literacy
Gauges reading proficiency rates. Literacy directly impacts how effectively a community can use printed Bibles and study materials, signaling the need for literacy programs or audio-based resources if rates are low.

Collectively, these submetrics form a comprehensive snapshot of a community’s practical needs and readiness for engagement with the Bible. By analyzing these factors, organizations can prioritize support and tailor their strategies—ensuring that every community has the best possible opportunity to access, understand, and benefit from biblical resources.
